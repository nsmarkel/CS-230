Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The gaming room client requested to make their game an online, multiplayer, web-based game. They required the software to be scalable and hold multiple players. 
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I outlined the requirements for this project very well. That gave a team of programmers an easier time taking the requirements and turning them into code. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  
  It felt a lot like an outline used to write the paper. With everything laid out, all I had to do while coding was write the code. This took the guess work out of the order the program needed to be wrote in. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would redo the table inside my document. I wasn't happy with the turnout of it and would have rather had bullet points of pro's and con's instead. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I took into consideration scaling up the game to hold more players profiles. I also took it upon myself to think of the server load and how they could expanding their server usage when the client had a bigger player base.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  
  I used the requirements laid out by the company religiously. I always had the requirments up when researching and developing the application. This helped me stay on task and not get sidetracked with ideas.
